# SlimyDungeon
A Slimy Rogue-Like created for the Ludum Dare 45 Game Jam

This project was a coding challenge, to create a game around the theme "Start with Nothing" in 72 hours.
The code was written by me, and some of the art assets were supplied by my team-member "Thunder".

We submitted the project before the 72 hour deadline and scored 343rd place overall.
